      <p><strong>About This Visualization:</strong> This chart compares visual acuity measurements between left and right eyes across different eye diagnoses. Visual acuity is measured in logMAR units, where lower values represent better vision (0.0 is equivalent to 20/20 vision, negative values are better than 20/20, and higher positive values indicate worse vision).</p>
      <p>The data shown represents average values for each diagnosis. You can switch between different view modes and filter by specific diagnoses using the controls above.</p>
      <p>The vertical lines with caps (error bars) represent Standard Error (SE), which indicates the precision of the mean estimate. Smaller error bars suggest more reliable average measurements.</p>
      <p class="disclaimer">Note: Only diagnoses with sufficient data points are displayed. Some patients may have multiple diagnoses.</p>

      <p><strong>Write-up: </strong>Our visual encodings regarding the x and y axes depend on which interactive view mode 
        the user selects. In the bar charts, the different diseases are on the x-axis while the visual acuity is on the y-axis, and in the scatter plot the right eye is on the x-axis while the left eye is on the y-axis. Our visualization includes 3 different types of graphs, including a paired bar chart, a scatter plot, and a differences chart. For color encodings, we originally chose blue for the right eye and orange for the left eye, but we have changed to red for the left eye and green for the right eye in order to follow a more standard practice (the nautical and aviation system). The bar charts include standard error lines, which convey the uncertainty of each bar. 
        </p>
      
        <p>We used three interactive techniques - various view modes, a diagnosis filter, and the option to alter the minimum number of patients per diagnosis group. Our interactive view modes allowed the user to toggle the graph view between a paired bar chart, a scatter plot, and a difference chart. The pair bar chart had diagnoses on the x-axis and visual acuity in logMAR units on the y-axis. This chart offered a side by side comparison of right and left visual acuity, effectively displaying the average magnitude of imbalance between right and left eyes. Meanwhile, the scatter plot showed right eye acuity on the x-axis and left eye acuity on the y-axis, and each data point represented one of possible diagnoses. The scatter plot showed how far each data point deviates from the y=x line, which represents equal visual acuity in both eyes. Where the point lies (above or below the y=x line) indicates which eye is worse and how strong the imbalance is. Finally, the difference chart, like the bar chart, had diagnoses on the x-axis, but instead of visual acuity on the y-axis it had the difference in visual acuity (RE-LE). Because of this, the difference chart most clearly shows for which diseases the right eye tends to be worse, versus which diseases the left eye is worse. Diseases where the right eye is worse are shown as positive, and portrayed in blue, while diseases where the left eye is worse are shown as negative, and portrayed in orange. The second interactive technique we used was a dropdown diagnosis filter, which allows the user to either view all the diagnoses at once, or view one specific disease of choice. This provides a closer view of the distribution of right versus left visual acuity per individual disease. Finally, we added an option to change the minimum number of patients, so that only diseases that have more than a certain number of patients would be shown.This allows the user to filter by prevalence of diseases in our sample, showing how common or uncommon certain diseases may be (assuming our sample is unbiased).
        </p>
        <p>We had four other alternative visualizations. One visualization allows you to input your age, sex, and visual acuity and places you on a line graph to see how you compare to others your age. Another shows the correlation between each of the diagnoses in the dataset, each link shows how often one diagnosis is followed by another. One shows how visual acuity has changed over time, and you are able to filter by different diseases and right or left eye. The last alternative shows different diseases that are associated with one another, and by clicking on each disease you can see the other diseases most associated with that one.</p>
        <p>The first step of our development process was picking a dataset and all 4 of us picked 3 different datasets we were interested in from Physionet, then we voted on our favorites. Together we chose a comprehensive dataset of “Pattern Electroretinograms for Ocular Electrophysiology Research” for our official dataset. We felt that there is a lot to say about eye diagnoses and that it is relevant to all individuals so we felt passionate about doing our project on this dataset. Next we collectively brainstormed different visualizations we could make from our dataset, whether that be looking at the correlation between age, gender, and acuity or the connection between diagnosis 1 and diagnosis 2 or more. Then we took these ideas and made 5 different visualizations and we split this up by each of us taking 1 visualization to make and then person made 2. Afterwards, we democratically decided to continue with the visualization you now see. Then together we brainstormed on how to improve the visualization and the visual encodings that come along with that, such as changing the colors of the bars. Finally half of the team focused on the write up, where the other half completed the decided upon edits. Overall the work was split evenly and we made any and all adjustments/decisions collectively. The development process was quite difficult at the beginning because we were not sure what dataset to use and the direction to take our dataset. We knew that these initial decisions were very important as they are the foundation of our project, but they were time consuming and agreement didn’t necessarily come right away. The coding aspect of the development process wasn’t as difficult since we knew the direction we wanted to go and had a clear visualization to create. Roughly we met for 7 hours discussing and working together and each worked 2 hours on our own. As briefly mentioned above, the aspect that took the most time was deciding which dataset to use as there are so many interesting and viable datasets on Physionet and we each found different datasets equally interesting. We found that it took time to agree on a dataset that we were all passionate about. Then finding our question required a deep dive into our dataset and coming to a conclusion was not quick there either.
